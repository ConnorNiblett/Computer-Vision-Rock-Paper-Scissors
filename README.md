# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors
In my first project with AiCore, I have been tasked with creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the site Teachable Machine. To begin with, I made sure to install all of the relevant environments to allow me to complete milestone 1, some of which included: Visual Studio Code; GitHub; Windows Powershell and TensorFlow. These allowed me to make my start on my project by going onto Teachable Machine and creating 4 classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. We were asked to create the 'nothing' class to allow the machine how to recognise when neither Rock, Paper or Scissors were being played. To do this, I used my web-cam to take many still images in various positions performing each action. By using more images and different positions, this allowed the trained machine to deduce with greater accuracy what action I was performing. Once I'd completed this after a few attempts of trial and error of what images I took of myself, and the machine had been trained to recognise my actions, I was able to make any action and have the machine feed back to at least 98% accuracy which option I chose.
